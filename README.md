Creating a well-structured network diagram will help you visualize and communicate the architecture of your Azure cloud setup effectively.
Creating a comprehensive network diagram for your cloud setup involves visualizing the architecture of your Azure resources, including VMs, virtual networks, subnets, load balancers, Docker containers, and Ansible deployment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to structure your diagram using draw.io:

Components to Include in the Diagram:
Azure Resource Group:
Represent the Azure resource group that contains all your resources.
Virtual Network (VNet):
Show the VNet with its specified IP address range.
Display associated subnets within the VNet.
Subnets:
Illustrate the subnets within the VNet, indicating their respective IP address ranges.
VMs (Virtual Machines):
Include each VM deployed in Azure, labeling them with hostnames and IP addresses (both internal and external where applicable).
Differentiate between VMs hosting Docker containers and those used for Ansible.
Load Balancer:
Display the load balancer used to distribute traffic across multiple VMs.
Indicate the specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP) being load balanced.
Docker Containers:
Show the VMs where Docker containers are running.
Represent Docker containers within the VMs, if necessary.
Ansible Deployment:
Highlight the VM where Ansible is deployed.
Indicate Ansible's role in managing or configuring other VMs or Docker containers.
Traffic Flow:
Use arrows or lines to depict the flow of specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH) within the network.
Security Groups:
Identify any security groups configured to allow/block specific types of traffic.
Steps to Create the Diagram:
Open draw.io:
Access draw.io using a web browser.
Select New Diagram:
Choose "Create New Diagram" to start a new drawing.
Add Azure Icons:
Utilize the shape libraries to add Azure-specific icons for VMs, VNets, subnets, load balancers, etc.
Arrange Components:
Drag and drop components onto the drawing canvas and arrange them logically to represent your network setup.
Connect Components:
Use connectors (arrows or lines) to visually connect components and illustrate traffic flow between them.
Label and Annotate:
Label each component with descriptive text (e.g., VM hostnames, IP addresses, subnet ranges).
Add annotations to explain specific configurations or functionalities.
Customize Appearance:
Customize the appearance of your diagram with colors, fonts, and styles to enhance clarity and readability.
Save and Export:
Save your diagram within draw.io's cloud storage or download it as an image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) for inclusion in your portfolio.
Example Diagram Structure:
Title: Cloud Network Architecture Diagram
Components:
Azure Resource Group
Virtual Network (VNet)
Subnet 1 (e.g., Web Servers)
Subnet 2 (e.g., Backend Services)
Load Balancer (Load Balancing HTTP Traffic)
VMs:
VM1 (Docker Host)
VM2 (Ansible Jump Box)
VM3 (Web Server with Docker Containers)
VM4 (Database Server)
Docker Containers:
Docker Container 1 (Web Application)
Docker Container 2 (Database)
Ansible Deployment (Managing Configuration of VMs)
Traffic Flow (HTTP, SSH)
Security Groups (Inbound/Outbound Rules)
Tips for Clarity:
Use consistent labeling and color schemes to differentiate between components.
Ensure that the diagram accurately reflects your cloud setup and is easy to understand for viewers.
Include a legend if necessary to explain symbols, colors, or abbreviations used in the diagram
